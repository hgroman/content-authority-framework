# The Content Authority Framework™

This repository is the single source of truth for our agency's proprietary, AI-powered content strategy process.

## 1. Purpose

This framework moves clients from "Content Chaos" (unstructured, "brute-force" AI-generated content) to "Content Authority."

The process was developed by stress-testing modern LLMs (Gemini, Claude, NotebookLM) and discovering their core limitation: **AI Dilution**. AI, like a human user, gets lost in the "noise" of a large, unstructured content library.

This framework solves that problem. It provides the **architecture** AI needs to generate "genius-level" strategic output and the **structure** Google requires to validate **E-E-A-T** (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).

## 2. The 4-Phase Process (The "True Work")

This is a repeatable system for auditing a client's content and building a strategic "Hub & Spoke" architecture.

* **Phase 1: Thematic Alignment (The "Compass"):** Identify the core mission, proof points, and strategic messaging.
* **Phase 2: Content Categorization (The "Folders"):** Index all content into logical, product-centric, and strategic categories.
* **Phase 3: Strategic Hubs (The "Pillars"):** Identify the 3-5 definitive "Hub" articles that will anchor the client's authority.
* **Phase 4: Technical Tagging (The "Lifecycle"):** Implement version, lifecycle, and compatibility tags for technical content.
